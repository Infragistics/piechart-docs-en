* link:{PieChartLink}.{PieChartBase}{ApiProp}valuememberpath.html[ValueMemberPath] - A string specifying the property name on the data model to be used as value, i.e. the arc length of each pie slice.
* link:{PieChartLink}.{PieChartBase}{ApiProp}labelmemberpath.html[LabelMemberPath] - This string specifies the property name on the data model to be used as label, i.e. the text that appears on each pie slice and inside the legend.
